# A description of the algo
Given:
Grid Size: H x W
Laser_Scan for every timestep
Ground truth 

Assumption:
Obstacles are circles of radius 6

Initialize:
State_Map: 0
State_Prob: 0

prior = State_prob

for every time step, t:
    State_Prob = update belief for every pixel by Inverse Sensor Model
    State_Map = generate state map from posterior (p > 0.5 = 255, else 0)
    Connected component labelling on State_Map
        centroid, area, bounding box of every connected component
    for every connected component
        if (area > 2)
            State_Map = place obstacles on state_map at center of bounding boxes
            State_Prob = update posterior with probabilities of centroid of obstacles
    
generate error wrt ground truth
